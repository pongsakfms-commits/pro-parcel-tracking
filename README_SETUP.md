# How to Run Your Tracking App

Since we created the files manually, follow these steps to get your app running.

## 1. Install Node.js (Required)
If you don't have it, download and install "LTS" version from: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
After installing, open a new terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).

## 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to your project folder and run:
```bash
cd d:\xampp\htdocs\Tracking
npm install
```

## 3. Run the App
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You will see a link like `http://localhost:5173`. Click it to view your app!

## Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx`: The main logic and UI of the tracking page.
- `src/index.css`: The styling file containing the Dark/Premium theme.
- `package.json`: List of libraries we used (React, Lucide, Firebase).
